                Introduction
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language essential for web development. Originally
                designed to add interactivity to websites, it has evolved into a powerful tool for creating dynamic web
                applications. By manipulating HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables developers to craft engaging user
                experiences that respond to user actions in real time.</P>
            <p>Today, JavaScript runs in the browser, making it accessible and easy to integrate with various frameworks
                and libraries like React and Angular. Its capabilities extend beyond front-end development, as it is
                also widely used for back-end programming with environments like Node.js. This flexibility has
                solidified JavaScript's place as one of the most important languages in modern programming.</p>

                Why choose Javascript
            </header>
            <p>Choosing JavaScript offers several advantages for developers. Its versatility allows you to create both
                front-end and back-end applications, making it a one-stop solution for full-stack development. With a
                vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React and Node.js, you can enhance productivity and
                streamline the development process. Additionally, JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers,
                ensuring broad compatibility and easy deployment. Its active community provides extensive resources and
                support, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.</P>

                Getting started
            </header>
            <p>Here are some important things beginners should know before starting to learn JavaScript:</P>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Computer Skills</strong>: Familiarity with using a computer and navigating files and
                    folders is helpful.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding of the Web</strong>: Knowing how websites work and the role of browsers will
                    provide context for JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Be ready to explore various resources like online courses,
                    tutorials, and documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience and Practice</strong>: Learning to code takes time; regular practice and
                    experimentation are key to mastering JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging Skills</strong>: Be prepared to troubleshoot and debug your code, as errors are a
                    normal part of the learning process.</li>
                <li><strong>Curiosity and Problem-Solving</strong>: A willingness to explore and solve problems will
                    enhance your learning experience.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>
                Hello world
            </header>
            <p>The first line of code most people begin with is writing "Hello, World!".</P>
            <p>To write "Hello, World!" in JavaScript, you can use the console.log() function. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
            </p>
            <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>
                Declaring variables
            </header>
            <p>In JavaScript, you can declare a variable in three primary ways:</P>
            <p>The first way is using the keyword 'var'. For example:</p>
            <code>var name = "John";</code>
            <p>The second way is using the keyword 'let'. For example:</p>
            <code>let name = "John";</code>
            <p>The third way is using the keyword 'const'. For example:</p>
            <code>const name = "John";</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>
                Functions
            </header>
            <p>Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. You can define a
                function with a name, include parameters for input, and use the return keyword to send back a result. By
                using functions, you can organize your code better and avoid repeating the same code multiple times.
                Let's look at a simple example:</P>
            <code>
          function add(a, b) {<br>
          return a + b;<br>
          }<br>
          let result = add(2, 3); // result is 5<br>
          console.log(result);<br>
          </code>
        </section>
